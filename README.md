# Modular optimized ant farm system

In many modular ant farm designs I found here and there on the net, the connecting parts are thick and cumbersome.
The walls are very thick, leading to modules featuring more plastic than space.

This is my trial at having something slim and optimized with as little as possible lost space.
It requires a well adjusted printer, because the tolerance is rather small.

Several modules are available:

- wet module, with a tank for foam drown in water, and cells for the ants eggs (or whatever they choose to store there)
- expanded wet module, with a bigger tank but no cell
- dry module with cells
- harvest module to set their food (seeds)
- water dispenser, in case humidity is not sufficient, ants need to drink

Modules can be connected with doors, optionnally closeable, and their unused connection pods will be closed by shutters.

My friend who is an ant fanatic bought one on Ebay, but the water dispenser is not well designed, and several ants drowned. He asked for my water dispenser so I designed a connector to connect to his modules.

All this is shown on this picture:
